Dear Chemist Warehouse Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Pharmacy Assistant Expression of Interest opportunity. With over 8 years of retail experience focused on customer service excellence, combined with strong organizational and communication skills, I am eager to transition my retail expertise into the pharmacy environment.

Throughout my career at Dick Smith Electronics and Big W, I have consistently demonstrated the core competencies essential for a successful Pharmacy Assistant. My experience in high-volume retail environments has equipped me with the skills necessary to thrive in a customer-focused pharmacy setting.

Key strengths that align with the Pharmacy Assistant role:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Customer service excellence:} 8+ years providing exceptional service to diverse customer groups, ensuring positive experiences and building lasting relationships
\item \textbf{Communication skills:} Proven ability to communicate clearly and professionally with customers, team members, and management
\item \textbf{Organizational capabilities:} Experience managing inventory, merchandising, and back-of-house operations with attention to detail
\item \textbf{POS and systems proficiency:} Extensive experience with point-of-sale systems, transaction processing, and cash handling
\item \textbf{Team collaboration:} Strong track record of working effectively within teams while contributing to store operations
\item \textbf{Reliability and adaptability:} Consistent attendance record and flexibility to work across various shifts and locations
\item \textbf{Learning enthusiasm:} Eager to pursue S2/S3 training or Community Pharmacy certification pathways
\end{itemize}

While I am new to the pharmacy sector, my strong foundation in retail customer service, combined with my genuine interest in health and wellness, positions me to quickly adapt and excel as a Pharmacy Assistant. I am particularly drawn to Chemist Warehouse's commitment to providing affordable healthcare solutions and exceptional customer service.

I am available for Part-Time, Full-Time, or Casual positions across multiple locations and am committed to pursuing relevant pharmacy qualifications to advance in this career path. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my retail experience and dedication to customer service can contribute to your pharmacy team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Aaron De Vries
