Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in retail positions that leverage my extensive customer service experience and passion for technology and consumer electronics.

With over 8 years of retail experience at Dick Smith Electronics and Big W, I have developed strong skills in customer-focused sales, POS operations, inventory management, and team collaboration. My background spans consumer electronics, home entertainment, technology, and appliances across diverse customer groups.

Key highlights of my retail experience include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Exceptional customer service and result-driven sales in consumer electronics
\item POS system operation, cash handling, and high-volume transaction processing  
\item Merchandising, inventory management, and back-of-house operations
\item Team training, mentoring, and performance support
\item Loss prevention awareness and store security protocols
\end{itemize}

I am passionate about technology, music, and gaming, which aligns well with retail environments focusing on consumer electronics and entertainment. My enthusiasm for these areas, combined with my proven retail expertise, enables me to provide knowledgeable recommendations and exceptional customer experiences.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my retail experience and customer-focused approach can contribute to your team's success. I am available for immediate start and look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Aaron De Vries
