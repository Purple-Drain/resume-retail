Hiring Manager \\
JB Hi-Fi Burwood \\\\[0.6\baselineskip]
Dear Hiring Manager, \\\\[0.4\baselineskip]
I'm excited to apply for the Retail Team Member role at JB Hi-Fi Burwood. With hands-on experience in consumer electronics at Dick Smith and Big W, I know how to deliver great service, run POS during busy trading, and maintain strong merchandising and stock standards.
What excites me most is contributing to the opening of a brand-new JB Hi-Fi store. First impressions shape loyalty and reputation. I'm keen to help set a positive, customer-first culture from day one so Burwood customers immediately associate the new location with trusted service and expertise.
I bring a mix of retail know-how and IT experience that makes me confident with tech. I've exceeded sales targets, solved customer problems, and built repeat business. My software engineering background sharpened my problem-solving and teamwork—ideal for fast-paced environments.
Most importantly, I genuinely love technology, entertainment, gaming, and music—passions that match JB Hi-Fi's culture. I'd love to bring my energy to your new Burwood team and help build a strong foundation for lasting success.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, \\
Aaron De Vries
